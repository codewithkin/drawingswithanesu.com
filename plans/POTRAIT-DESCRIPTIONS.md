# Mother-child-zebra-potrait-description:
The bond between the two<mother and her offspring >

Charcoal and pastel
64 by 45cm 

As an artist, I'm always aiming to convey what I feel inside. My mother left me when I was 2, and im the only child. I grew up in an environment that was filled with women. I thought one day I could fill that whole, but it's still void. On this drawing, I had time to research and see how zebras raise their offspring, and they always have one fowl. Which really resembles me, the fowl is nurtured how to walk, and everything that a mother would do and teach their fowl growing up. 

This drawing shows the journey of a fowl yearning for their mothers' love. It's a journey. But it saves a message to the ones who still have their Mothers alive, showering them with love, and appreciating them

# Single lion potrait description
His majesty

Charcoal 

Lions are always symbols of majestic and power.  This drawing was linked to my mothers totem for me to remind myself that there's a lion in me ,the king in me, which I need to embrace. I got so in tune with it that finishing it wasn't the core point and perfecting it but to just enjoy the moment and know that you're always evolving every day. Kings always make it a core point that the castle or the empire they're ruling are evolving and growing. In this drawing, I symbolized the castle as myself. I rule and sharpen, which is always growing.

This drawing reminds us to go back to our castles and reign the power. You're the King of your Castle. Don't let anybody rule over you.

# Animal-eyes-potrait:
Window to your soul

Charcoals and pastel
91 by 64 cm 

As a wildlife artist, I got bored drawing still animals and let my subconscious mind take a ride on this one. I just merged different pictures from different photographers I've asked consent on before I used their pictures. There's joy in creating your own references. In this drawing, I made different eyes and parts of the animals. Each eye resembled its story. I created this piece as a mirror for people to look within and realise the power inside them.

This was when I realised the power of the subconscious mind, and i was helped by reading the book of how to draw with the right side of the brain. 

Every day, you need to reflect on your inner thoughts, and I've created the mirror for you

This was the most intricate and detailed drawing I've done, when I looked at the reference of this drawing I was astounded and overwhelmed at the same time ,I started it on a small paper A3 size but my heart yearned for more and then I restarted it on an A1 paper bigger paper. I still remember moving In one place to another with my drawing I started this drawing when I was in Harare and then I started school in bulawayo but I ddnt not leave my drawing behind I still remember joining this youth club the place which gave me space to draw. This drawing was a battlefield between two poles positive and negative,  yin and yang, men and women.  During this battlefield, I was strong and resilient until I've finished it with hard struggle. There's this saying that Diamond is not formed under low pressure but under excruciating pain creates beauty. 
This piece holds a special place in my heart and hopes it holds one's in your heart and home.

Motherland

Charcoal and pastel


Africa isn't called Mother Land for no reason,  I had to dive deeper for starting this drawings. The inspiration was effortless because everything was right in front of me. I had to go to victoria Falls to witness one of the seven wonders and capture the flow of the water and then imprint it on the drawings. I'm always drawn by the sunset, here in Africa sunsets hits different because you're drawn to them the orange hues and yellow dawn tones you can always stare and let the soul revitalised by these glare. Not forgetting the harmonious living In Nature how they live perfectly with each other without commotion and destruction.  

I advice on your bucket list Add Africa like the whole Africa for a holiday, for you to experience Godly Nature Feelings the feeling that lives inside us forever. 

Hope this piece inspires you to travel more.

# Stability: lazy gaze cheetah

Cheetah is known for its flexibility and speed when hunting, but it's not always when it has the energy to hunt, but sometimes it takes time to rest and gather momentum for the next hunt. As I was drawing this piece, I realised it's not always when you have the energy, resting it's vital for progress take a break from life's struggles and wait till you've gain the energy and momentum, when your mind has settled and then you progress on.

It's okay to take a break. It's vital for progress.

# Wild dog with deep eyes:
Light within

Charcoal and pastel 
64 by 45 cm

This piece was inspired by the light which shines within, wilddogs are known for being cunning and whimsical animals in nature and it's  hard to soldier on the jungle full of big animals wanting the same prey but wilddog always have their way through which is fascinating.
 There's a time in my life when everything wasn't going well but I had that lil spark which made me go on even though the road was tough and blurry. As I was drawing the elegant eyes of this wilddog the colour symbolized the bright future I saw for myself,colouring this vibrant and colourful eyes made me realise theres light withinmyself which needs to be released. The body maybe be greyscale but the light within always shines through when God permits. Take this piece as a reminder to always see bright colours even in the midst of disaster there's hope God is working everyda
